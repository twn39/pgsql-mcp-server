# PgSQL MCP Server

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pgsql-mcp-server)](https://pypi.org/project/pgsql-mcp-server/)

**A powerful tool server based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling interaction with PostgreSQL databases via MCP calls.**

---

## üöÄ Overview


This project is built on the `FastMCP` framework and leverages the `SQLAlchemy` and `asyncpg` libraries to deliver high-performance asynchronous database operations, ensuring efficiency and responsiveness when handling database requests.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Asynchronous & Efficient:** Fully asynchronous implementation based on `asyncio`, utilizing `asyncpg` for a high-performance asynchronous PostgreSQL driver.
*   **Transactional Safety:** DDL, DML, and DCL operations are executed within transactions with error handling and rollback mechanisms.
*   **Easy Deployment:** Start the server with a simple command line interface.

## üì¶ Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Installation via `uvx` is recommended:

```bash
uvx pgsql-mcp-server --dsn postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db
```

## üîç Preview and Debugging

You can use the official MCP Inspector tool to visually inspect the tools provided by this server, view their parameters and descriptions, and perform test calls directly.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx pgsql-mcp-server --dsn "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
```

This will start a local web service. Open the provided URL in your browser to begin debugging.
